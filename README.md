# MyUI ultimate UI collection 

I don't suggest anything but I think it is **hot**.

## Pick what you like and implement in your own code

Each section is divided by few empty lines in the HTML and JavaScript files each of them has separate SASS file as well. This is for you to easily slide through and find what you want. I mean usually going through the source code is kinda long and boring not just because it is often very long itself and contains thousands lines of code but as well because it is hard to find all the pieces of code you really need. 

Necessary functions are often stacked in one place with dozens of others. HTML and CSS (SASS) might be written in a weird style so that you can't understand what is what. 

**NOT IN VICLAND!!!**

> I will try to organize all the code in a way that is easy and clear.

Enjoy.
